      "*   **`def test_standard_leap_years(self):`** (and similar methods):\n",
      "    *   Each method starting with `test_` is recognized by `unittest` as a test case.\n",

      "    *   **`self.assertFalse(condition, message)`**: Asserts that `condition` is `False`. If `condition` is `True`, the test fails, and `message` is displayed.\n",
      "    *   We provide a variety of years covering all the rules:\n",
      "        *   Years divisible by 4 but not 100 (standard leap years).\n",
      "        *   Years divisible by 400 (century leap years).\n",
      "        *   Years not divisible by 4 (standard non-leap years).\n",
      "        *   Years divisible by 100 but not 400 (century non-leap years).\n",
      "        *   Edge case: Year 0 (mathematically a leap year by the rules).\n",
      "        *   Negative years (to check robustness, though typically years are positive).\n",
      "*   **`if __name__ == '__main__': unittest.main()`**: This block allows you to run the tests directly from the command line by executing the test file.\n"
